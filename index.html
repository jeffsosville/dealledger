This is **very close** to the right “EDGAR / public record” vibe. The structure and restraint are good.

But there are **4 credibility bugs** (not style opinions) that hostile engineers will catch, plus **3 copy/UX tweaks** that make the “not a marketplace” stance feel inevitable.

---

## 4 credibility bugs to fix now

### 1) “First Seen” is currently **scraped_at** (wrong concept)

Your table header says **First Seen**, but you render:

```js
formatDate(listing.scraped_at)
```

That’s not “first seen,” that’s “observed on this scrape.” If you re-export daily, “First Seen” will change every day and you’ll look dishonest.

**Fix options:**

* If you *have* `first_seen` in the data: display that.
* If you don’t: rename the column header to **Observed** (or **Observed At**) and keep using `scraped_at`.

**Minimal safe change:** rename the header to **Observed**.

---

### 2) Title links and Source links both point to `listing_url`

Right now:

* Title anchor → `listing.listing_url`
* Source arrow → `listing.listing_url`

So “Source” is redundant. Also: your “public record” posture wants **source_url** (where you observed it) distinct from a canonical target.

**Fix:**

* Title should link to a **stable source** URL (`source_url`), not an internal or derived URL.
* Arrow should link to the **same source_url** (or to a second field `broker_url` if you want both).

If you only have one URL, keep *one* link, not two.

---

### 3) The “anti-shopping default” sorting is by `scraped_at` — that’s not “oldest first”

You sort by:

```js
new Date(a.scraped_at) - new Date(b.scraped_at)
```

That’s “oldest scrape,” not “oldest listing.” If you overwrite latest.json daily, everything has roughly the same scraped_at anyway.

**Fix:**

* Sort by `first_seen` if available.
* If not, sort by a stable listing identifier or remove the claim from the UI (“Sorted by oldest first”) until you have first_seen in the dataset.

### 4) The About section makes a high-risk claim you can’t prove: “Brokers can list fake businesses”

This line:

> “Brokers can list fake businesses.”

That’s an assertion about intent and fraud. You don’t need it — and it invites the wrong fight.

Replace accusation with observables you *do* measure:

* duplicates
* relists
* zombies
* missing broker-direct sources
* no audit trail

**Replace the whole first paragraph with something like:**

> **The problem:** There is no public registry for business listings. The same listing can appear multiple times across sites, disappear without notice, and persist after removal. Inventory is not auditable.

This keeps the edge, but makes it falsifiable.

---

## 3 tweaks that make the stance bulletproof

### A) Add “Tier” column (even if it’s only “Broker-direct” for now)

Right now your UI claims “public record” but the table doesn’t show classification. That’s your differentiator.

Add a column: **Tier** (or **Class**)

* Verified
* Marketplace-only
* Relist
* Zombie
* Non-canonical

If you aren’t computing tiers yet, show:

* `Broker-direct observed` (temporary)
  and explicitly note “tiers coming as marketplace ingestion begins.”

This prevents overclaiming.

---

### B) Make the notice stricter and more “ledger-y”

Current notice:

> “Data is scraped from broker websites and published without modification.”

That’s strong, but “without modification” is technically false if you normalize/dedupe.

Change to:

> **Observed from public sources. Normalized for consistency. No rankings. No promotion. No lead capture.**

Truthful and aligned.

---

### C) Fix the “How it works” claim: “1,600+ broker websites daily”

Your current run log shows 50 brokers. The site claims:

> “Automated scrapers pull listings from 1,600+ broker websites.”

If that’s aspirational, it must be stated as such. Otherwise critics will call it bullshit.

Change to:

> “Automated scrapers pull listings from broker websites. Coverage expands over time.”

And optionally show the real number:

* “Brokers tracked: X” (you already do!)

Let the number speak.

---

## Minimal edit pack (copy/paste changes)

### 1) Rename header “First Seen” → “Observed”

In `<th>`:

```html
<th>Observed</th>
```

### 2) Use a distinct `source_url` if available

In render:

```js
const href = listing.source_url || listing.listing_url || '#';
```

Use `href` for both title and arrow (or remove arrow).

### 3) Tone down About’s first paragraph

Replace:

> “Brokers can list fake businesses. Marketplaces inflate their counts…”

with:

> “There is no public registry for business listings. The same listing can appear multiple times across sites, disappear without notice, and persist after removal. Inventory is not auditable.”

### 4) Remove “1,600+ daily” unless it’s true today

Replace with coverage-expands language.

---

## One optional improvement that’s very “truth system”

Add a tiny footer line:

> **Snapshot:** `data/latest.json` • **SHA-256:** (from manifest)

If you don’t have a manifest yet, skip the hash for now — but that’s the direction.

---

If you tell me what fields actually exist in `data/latest.json` (paste one sample object), I’ll give you the exact final version of the render logic so it correctly shows **Observed/First Seen**, uses the right URL fields, and doesn’t overclaim.
